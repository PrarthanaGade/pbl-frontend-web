          <h1>About Our Project</h1>
          <p>
            This fintech platform is our university project, developed over the course of two months
            by <strong>Prarthana, Ruturaj, and Uday Kiran</strong>. Our mission was to create a user-friendly 
            and feature-rich financial management tool while enhancing our technical and problem-solving skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through this project, we gained valuable experience in UI/UX design, coding practices, and 
            deploying a real-world application.
