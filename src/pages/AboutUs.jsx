        <h1>About Our Project</h1>
        <p>
          This fintech platform is our university project, developed over the course of two months
          by <strong>Prarthana, Ruturaj, and Uday Kiran</strong>. Our mission was to create a user-friendly 
          and feature-rich financial management tool while enhancing our technical and problem-solving skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this project, we gained valuable experience in UI/UX design, coding practices, and 
          deploying a real-world application.
